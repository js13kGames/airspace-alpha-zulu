JS13KGames entry for 2021, theme is "**SPACE**".

## Airspace Alpha Zulu

You are a test pilot in the navy and are out on operations testing an experimental new jet, callsign Alpha Zulu. Your task is to launch from the aircraft carrier, fly around and then safely land back on the carrier. Use cursor keys/WASD/gamepad to fly, Q/E lateral adjustments, PageUp/PageDown throttle. Speed is shown on the HUD on the left in knots, altitude on the right in feet, compass at the top. Slow to about 60 knots, then make your landing approach. Good luck.
